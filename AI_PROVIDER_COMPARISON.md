Claude Response:
"Analyzing your 3 diesel vehicles:

1. VAN-001: 8.5 km/L (below fleet average of 9.0)
   - 28% fuel wasted on idling
   - 2 active DTCs including P0300 (misfire)
   - NEEDS ATTENTION: Engine fault affecting efficiency

2. TRK-142: 6.2 km/L (expected for heavy truck)
   - Currently idle, not in active use
   - DEF level low (8%)
   
3. TRK-089: 7.1 km/L (good for truck category)
