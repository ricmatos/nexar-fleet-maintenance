```

**Cost Analysis:**
```
What's my total daily fuel cost?
```

**Vehicle Comparison:**
```
Compare the fuel efficiency of all my vehicles
```

**Maintenance Planning:**
```
Show me vehicles with active faults
```

**Performance Insights:**
```
Which vehicle has the best fuel efficiency?
```

## Pro Tips üí°

1. **Be Specific**: Include vehicle IDs when asking about specific vehicles
   - ‚úÖ "What's wrong with VAN-001?"
   - ‚ùå "What's wrong with the van?"

2. **One Question at a Time**: Better responses when focused
   - ‚úÖ "Which vehicles have low battery?"
   - ‚ùå "Tell me about battery, fuel, and maintenance"

3. **Use the Context**: The AI knows what page you're on
   - On Dashboard: Ask about overall fleet metrics
   - On Vehicles: Ask about specific vehicle details

4. **Save Conversations**: Click "+ New Chat" to start fresh topics

## Troubleshooting üîß

**"Please configure your API key"**
- Make sure you clicked "Save Settings" after pasting the key

**"API request failed"**
- Double-check your API key is correct
- Verify you have credits remaining in your AI account
- Check your internet connection

**Slow responses?**
- Normal! AI typically takes 3-10 seconds
- Larger fleets = more data = slightly slower

**No response?**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Try refreshing the page
- Try a different AI provider

## Cost Estimates üí∞

Approximate cost per 100 queries:

- **Claude**: $0.50 - $1.00
- **GPT-4**: $1.00 - $2.00  
- **Gemini**: FREE (within limits)

Your $5 free credits = 500-1000 queries! üéâ

## Privacy & Security üîí

- API keys stored only in your browser
- Fleet data sent to AI only when you ask a question
- Conversations saved locally in browser
