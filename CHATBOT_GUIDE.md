## How to Use üí¨

### Starting a Conversation

1. **Open the chatbot** by clicking the floating button
2. Type your question in the input field
3. Press Enter or click the Send button

### Example Questions

**Fleet Overview:**
- "What's the overall health of my fleet?"
- "Which vehicles need immediate attention?"
- "Show me the total daily fuel cost"
- "What's my fleet's average fuel efficiency?"

**Vehicle-Specific:**
- "Which vehicle has the lowest health score?"
- "Show me all vehicles with active faults"
- "Which trucks are currently idle?"
- "Compare fuel efficiency between VAN-001 and TRK-142"

**Cost Analysis:**
- "What's my most expensive vehicle to operate?"
- "Calculate total weekly fuel cost"
- "Which vehicles exceed target cost per km?"

**Maintenance & Alerts:**
- "List all vehicles with critical alerts"
- "Which vehicles are due for maintenance?"
- "Show me vehicles with low battery warnings"
- "What DTCs are active in my fleet?"

**Performance Optimization:**
- "Which vehicles have excessive idle time?"
- "Identify vehicles with poor fuel efficiency"
- "Show me vehicles with high engine load"

### Managing Conversations

**Create New Chat:**
- Click the "+ New Chat" button
- Previous conversations are saved

**Switch Conversations:**
- Click on any conversation tab to switch
- All messages are preserved

**Delete Conversations:**
- Click the trash icon next to a conversation
- This action cannot be undone

## Data Provided to AI üìä

The chatbot automatically includes the following context with each query:

### Fleet-Level Metrics:
- Total vehicles, active/idle breakdown
- Fleet health index (0-100)
- Average fuel efficiency (km/L)
- Fuel cost per kilometer
- Daily fuel costs
- Active faults count
- Maintenance due/overdue
- Idle fuel loss percentage

### Vehicle-Level Details (up to 20 vehicles):
- Vehicle ID, VIN, type, fuel type, status
- Health score
- Fuel consumption (daily, moving, idle)
- Cost metrics (per km, daily)
- Engine parameters (RPM, load, torque)
- Vitals (battery voltage, coolant temp, oil pressure)
- Speed, odometer reading
- Active DTCs and alerts

### Current Context:
- Which page you're viewing (Dashboard, Vehicles, Alerts)
- Timestamp of the query

## Cost Estimation üí∞

Each query sends approximately:
- **Input tokens**: 2,000-4,000 (depending on fleet size)
- **Output tokens**: 500-1,000 (depending on response length)

**Estimated costs per 100 queries:**
- Claude: ~$0.50 - $1.00
- GPT-4: ~$1.00 - $2.00
- Gemini: Free (within daily limits)

## Privacy & Security üîí

- **API keys** are stored only in your browser's localStorage
- **Fleet data** is sent to the AI provider only when you ask a question
- **No data** is stored on external servers (except temporary processing by AI provider)
- **Conversations** are saved locally in your browser
- Clear your browser data to remove all stored conversations and API keys

## Troubleshooting üîß

### "Please configure your API key in settings"
- Click the settings icon
- Verify your API key is entered correctly
- Make sure you selected the right provider
- Click "Save Settings"

### "API request failed" or "Error" messages
- **Invalid API key**: Check your API key is correct
- **Rate limits**: You may have exceeded the provider's rate limits
- **Network issues**: Check your internet connection
- **Quota exceeded**: Add billing information to your AI provider account

### Chatbot not responding
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify API key is still valid
- Try refreshing the page
- Try creating a new conversation

### Slow responses
- AI providers sometimes have high latency
- Larger fleet data = more tokens = slower processing
- Claude and GPT-4 typically respond in 2-10 seconds

## Best Practices üìù

1. **Be specific**: Instead of "tell me about my fleet", ask "which vehicles have health scores below 70?"

2. **Use vehicle IDs**: Reference specific vehicles when possible (e.g., "What's wrong with VAN-001?")

3. **Ask one thing at a time**: Multiple questions in one message may get partial answers

4. **Check context**: The AI only sees data from the current session - it doesn't remember previous visits

5. **Verify critical decisions**: While the AI is accurate, always verify important operational decisions with the raw data
