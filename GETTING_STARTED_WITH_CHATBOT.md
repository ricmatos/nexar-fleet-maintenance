## Example Conversations

### Fleet Health Check
```
You: "Give me a fleet health summary"

AI: "Your fleet health overview:

Overall Fleet Health: 66/100 (needs improvement)

Vehicles by Status:
- Active: 2 vehicles (67%)
- Idle: 1 vehicle (33%)

Key Concerns:
1. VAN-001 (Health: 72/100)
   - Critical: Engine Fault (P0300)
   - Medium: Oil Change Due
   
2. TRK-142 (Health: 58/100) - LOWEST
   - High: Low Tire Pressure
   - High: DEF Low
   - Battery: 11.8V (low)

3. CAR-227 (Health: 78/100)
   - Medium: Battery Low

Recommendations:
1. Immediate: Address TRK-142's tire pressure and battery
2. Soon: Service VAN-001's engine misfire
3. This week: Standard maintenance for all vehicles

Would you like details on any specific vehicle?"
```

### Cost Analysis
```
You: "Which vehicle costs the most to operate?"

AI: "Based on fuel cost per kilometer:

Most Expensive:
1. CAR-227: $0.26/km
   - Daily fuel cost: $18.75
   - Efficiency: 9.8 km/L
   - Type: Car (Gas)

2. VAN-001: $0.24/km
   - Daily fuel cost: $22.80
   - Efficiency: 8.5 km/L (below baseline)
   - Type: Van (Diesel)
   - Issue: Engine fault reducing efficiency

3. TRK-142: $0.18/km (most efficient)
   - Daily fuel cost: $12.45
   - Efficiency: 6.2 km/L
   - Type: Truck (Diesel)

Note: VAN-001's cost could be reduced by fixing the P0300 
engine fault, which is likely impacting fuel efficiency."
```

### Maintenance Planning
```
You: "What maintenance is due this week?"

AI: "Maintenance due in the next 7 days:

Overdue:
- VAN-001: Oil Change (Due: 15/03/2024)
  Priority: High
  Status: OVERDUE

Upcoming This Week:
- CAR-227: Tire Rotation (Due: 20/04/2024)
  Priority: Medium
  
- TRK-142: Brake Inspection (Due: 25/04/2024)
  Priority: High

Recommendation: Schedule VAN-001 oil change immediately. 
This may also help resolve the engine performance issues 
(P0300 code)."
```
