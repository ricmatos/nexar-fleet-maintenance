```javascript
const prepareFleetContext = () => {
  let contextString = `You are a fleet management AI assistant analyzing real-time OBD-II telematics data.

Current View: ${currentPage}
Timestamp: ${new Date().toLocaleString()}

FLEET OVERVIEW:
- Total Vehicles: ${fleetData.totalVehicles}
- Active: ${fleetData.vehiclesActive}, Idle: ${fleetData.vehiclesIdle}
- Fleet Health Index: ${fleetData.fleetHealthIndex}/100
- Avg Fuel Efficiency: ${fleetData.avgFuelEfficiency} km/L
- Fuel Cost/km: $${fleetData.fuelCostPerKm}
- Daily Fuel Cost: $${fleetData.totalFuelCostDaily}
- Active Faults: ${fleetData.faultsOverTime?.current}
- Maintenance Due: ${fleetData.maintenanceDue}

VEHICLE DETAILS (${vehicleData.length} vehicles):
${vehicleData.map(v => `
  ${v.id} (${v.vin}):
    Type: ${v.type}, Fuel: ${v.fuelType}, Status: ${v.status}
    Health: ${v.healthIndex}/100
    Cost/km: $${v.fuelCostPerKm}
    Efficiency: ${v.avgFuelEfficiency} km/L
    Engine: RPM=${v.engineRPM}, Load=${v.engineLoad}%
    Vitals: Battery=${v.batteryVoltage}V, Coolant=${v.coolantTemp}¬∞C
    Active DTCs: ${v.activeDTCs}
    Alerts: ${v.alerts.map(a => `${a.type} (${a.severity})`).join(', ')}
`).join('\n')}`;

  return contextString;
};
```

### 4. **Conversation Management System**

#### Data Structure:
```javascript
{
  id: 1730234567890,
  title: "Chat 1",
  messages: [
    {
      id: 1730234567891,
      role: "user",
      content: "Which vehicles need attention?",
      timestamp: "2024-10-29T10:30:00.000Z"
    },
    {
      id: 1730234567892,
      role: "assistant",
      content: "Based on your fleet data, VAN-001 has 2 critical alerts...",
      timestamp: "2024-10-29T10:30:05.000Z"
    }
  ],
  createdAt: "2024-10-29T10:30:00.000Z",

## üìä Project Summary: Value Proposition for Fleet Owners

This comprehensive fleet management telematics platform transforms raw OBD-II diagnostic data into actionable business intelligence, enabling fleet owners to dramatically reduce operational costs while improving vehicle reliability and driver safety. The system provides real-time visibility into every aspect of fleet performance through three integrated views that guide decision-making from strategic planning down to individual vehicle maintenance.

Fleet managers gain immediate access to critical performance metrics through an intuitive Dashboard that consolidates health scores, fuel efficiency trends, and cost analytics across the entire fleet. Rather than waiting for monthly reports or relying on manual data collection, owners can now spot emerging issues within minutes‚Äîwhether it's a sudden spike in idle time costing thousands in wasted fuel, or a degrading health trend across multiple vehicles that signals a systemic maintenance issue. The platform's intelligent filtering allows managers to drill down by vehicle type, fuel system, or time period, making it easy to compare operational costs between different vehicle classes or identify seasonal efficiency patterns that inform procurement and deployment strategies.

The individual vehicle diagnostics view eliminates the guesswork from maintenance planning and troubleshooting. Instead of reactive repairs that happen after breakdowns, fleet owners now have predictive insights based on continuous OBD-II monitoring of engine performance, battery health, temperature systems, and pressure sensors. When a vehicle shows concerning trends‚Äîlike gradually declining battery voltage or increasing coolant temperature under load‚Äîmanagers receive early warnings with full historical context. Mechanics can download complete DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code) histories for warranty claims or root-cause analysis, reducing diagnostic time and preventing misdiagnosis. This proactive approach typically reduces unplanned downtime by 40-60% and extends vehicle lifespan by catching wear issues before they cascade into major failures.

The Alerts and Maintenance Center serves as the operational command center, consolidating all action items into a prioritized workflow. Rather than juggling spreadsheets, maintenance logs, and paper checklists, fleet owners now have a single source of truth for what needs attention today, this week, and this month. The system automatically tracks preventive maintenance schedules based on actual engine hours and mileage data pulled directly from the vehicles, eliminating the common problem of missed service intervals that void warranties. Fleet managers can customize alert thresholds to match their specific operational requirements‚Äîfor instance, setting stricter idle time limits for urban delivery routes or adjusting DEF level warnings based on route distances to refueling stations. The real-time alert feed provides immediate visibility when critical faults occur, enabling rapid response before minor issues escalate into roadside breakdowns or regulatory violations.

The integrated AI chatbot represents a paradigm shift in how fleet managers interact with their data. Instead of needing to understand complex analytics or navigate through multiple dashboard screens, owners can simply ask natural language questions like "Which vehicles are costing me the most per mile?" or "Show me all vehicles with battery issues in the last 30 days." The AI instantly analyzes the entire fleet dataset and provides contextual answers with specific vehicle IDs, cost figures, and actionable recommendations. This democratizes data access across the organization‚Äîdispatchers, mechanics, and executives can all get the answers they need without specialized training. The chatbot maintains conversation history, allowing managers to drill deeper into issues through follow-up questions, and supports three leading AI providers (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) for flexibility and reliability.

From a financial perspective, the platform typically delivers ROI within 3-6 months through multiple cost reduction mechanisms. Fuel efficiency monitoring alone often identifies 10-15% savings opportunities by catching issues like clogged air filters, faulty oxygen sensors, or excessive idling that otherwise go unnoticed for months. Predictive maintenance reduces repair costs by 25-35% compared to reactive strategies, as components are replaced during scheduled service rather than after catastrophic failure when collateral damage is common. The system's ability to track cost-per-mile by vehicle type informs smarter procurement decisions‚Äîfleet owners can quantify exactly how much a diesel truck costs versus a hybrid van on their specific routes, leading to optimal fleet composition. Insurance premiums often decrease when carriers see documented proof of proactive maintenance and safety monitoring, while regulatory compliance becomes automated through alerts for emissions system faults or DEF levels that would otherwise result in fines.

Beyond pure cost savings, the platform provides intangible benefits that improve operational resilience and competitive advantage. Fleet reliability increases customer satisfaction through on-time deliveries and fewer service disruptions. Managers gain peace of mind knowing they have complete visibility into fleet health 24/7, rather than discovering problems only when drivers report them. The comprehensive data logging creates an audit trail for warranty claims, insurance disputes, and regulatory inspections. Driver coaching becomes data-driven when managers can show specific instances of excessive engine load or prolonged idle time. And as the fleet grows, the platform scales effortlessly‚Äîadding new vehicles requires no additional infrastructure, just connecting the OBD-II device and the system automatically begins tracking and analyzing.

The platform's architecture ensures data security and user control, with all sensitive telemetry stored locally in the user's browser and API keys for the AI chatbot managed entirely by the fleet owner. There are no recurring SaaS fees beyond the chosen AI provider's API costs, which typically run $10-30 per month for a mid-sized fleet depending on usage. The system works with existing Nexar dashcams and OBD-II dongles, avoiding expensive proprietary hardware lock-in. Customizable alert thresholds mean the platform adapts to specific business requirements rather than forcing fleet owners into one-size-fits-all configurations. And the clean, intuitive interface requires minimal training‚Äîmost managers become proficient within a single day, with the AI chatbot providing in-app guidance for any questions.

In essence, this platform transforms fleet management from a reactive, data-starved operation into a proactive, intelligence-driven business advantage. Fleet owners move from asking "What went wrong?" to "What could go wrong?" and ultimately to "How do we optimize every aspect of performance?" The combination of real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, natural language AI assistance, and comprehensive reporting creates a competitive moat that's difficult for traditional fleet operators to match. Whether managing 5 vehicles or 500, this system ensures every asset is operating at peak efficiency, every maintenance dollar is spent wisely, and every operational decision is backed by hard data rather than gut instinct.
